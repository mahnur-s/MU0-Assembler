# MU0-Assembler
This project is a mu0 assembler implementation that translates a set of mu0 assembly language instructions into machine language. The mu0 instruction set includes basic operations like load, store, add, subtract, jump, and stop. The assembler handles labels, numeric literals, and character literals, converting them to appropriate hexadecimal machine code. The code is designed to process a 2D array of assembly instructions and output a 2D array of corresponding machine language instructions in hexadecimal format. This project is essential for understanding low-level programming and the workings of an assembler in a simplified computer architecture context.
